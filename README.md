# Clustering in Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains resources and implementations related to clustering in machine learning. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on certain criteria or features. This README serves as a guide to understand the concept of clustering, available algorithms, usage, and implementations.

## Introduction to Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to partition data into groups or clusters such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. It's commonly used for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and feature engineering.

Key concepts in clustering include:

- **Clusters**: Groups of data points that are similar to each other.
- **Centroids**: Representative points within each cluster.
- **Distance Measures**: Metrics used to determine the similarity between data points.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Various methods used to perform clustering.

## Clustering Algorithms

There are several clustering algorithms, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and areas of application. Some popular clustering algorithms include:

- **K-means**: A partitioning method where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as the prototype of the cluster.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree of clusters, where each node represents a cluster containing one or more data points.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Groups together closely packed points based on a density criterion.
- **Mean Shift**: Non-parametric clustering technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.

## Usage

Clustering can be used for various purposes, including:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying groups of customers with similar behavior for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual patterns or outliers in data.
- **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into meaningful regions.
- **Document Clustering**: Grouping similar documents together for topic modeling or information retrieval.

## Implementations

This repository contains implementations of clustering algorithms in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Each implementation includes documentation and examples to facilitate understanding and usage.
